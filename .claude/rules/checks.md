# Local checks

What has to pass before a push, what a pull request runs, and what reports coverage. **This file is the project's, not the
installer's**: it starts with whatever the setup could read off the build files, and it is filled in
by the work itself — a ticket that adds a linter adds its line here, in the same pass.

| What | Command |
|---|---|
| before a push | *not recorded yet* |
| on every pull request | *not recorded yet* |
| coverage | *not recorded yet* |

## How to use it

**Run what the table names, before every push.** Finding a failure here costs one minute; finding it
in CI costs a round trip.

**A line that says *not recorded yet* is a question, not a permission to skip.** Look for the answer
where it is written down — the build file (`package.json`, `pom.xml`, `build.sbt`, `pyproject.toml`,
`Makefile`…), the CI workflow, the README — run what you find, and **write it into the table in the
same pass**. Nothing to find, because the project has no tests yet? Say so in the report and leave
the line as it is: the ticket that brings the first test is the one that fills it.

**A command that no longer works is a bug in this file.** Fix the line rather than working around it,
and say in the report that you changed it.

**A check this table names that a pull request does not run is a divergence.** The remote check and
the local one answer the same question, and the cheapest way to keep them from drifting apart is for
the workflow to run the command named here rather than a list of its own. When it does keep its own
list, a line added above is a line to add there in the same pass — otherwise the check exists only on
the machine that just did the work, which is the one machine it cannot catch out.

Coverage has no line when the project measures none. That is a stated absence, and the report says
so — an absent section reads like an oversight.

## Beyond the table

Anything else the project needs run or checked by hand — a database to start, a fixture to generate,
an environment variable to export — belongs here too, under a heading of its own. A convention that
lives only in someone's memory is one that the next iteration will break.
